The eventual configuration was a single, 45 ft (13.7 m) main rotor with four 60 in (152.4 cm) propellers on the wings. The wing propellers provided counter-torque to the rotor for takeoff and landing and forward thrust in cruise flight when the main rotor was slowed to 100 rpm.","['http://carteraero.com/', 'https://www.facebook.com/CarterCopters/', 'https://twitter.com/CarterAvTech', 'https://www.youtube.com/user/CarterAviationTech/videos', 'https://www.linkedin.com/company/carter-aerospace-development', 'https://www.jauntairmobility.com/', 'https://www.flightglobal.com/what-is-the-mu-1-barrier/61627.article', '/news/air-mobility-bonanza-beckons-electric-vtol-developers/', 'http://www.cartercopters.com/system/sdocs/28/original/Carter%20Presentation.2017-04-25.Uber%20Elevate%20Summit%202.pdf?1493651657', 'https://verticalmag.com/press-releases/carter-partners-mooney-uber-elevate-air-taxi-concept/', 'https://evtol.news/__media/PDFs/Carter-Presentation-CAFE-Elec-AC-Symposium-w-video.pdf', 'http://www.aero-news.net/subsite.cfm?do=main.textpost&id=62c0ee11-a6e6-4454-9e13-77e1f8c923b7', 'https://youtu.be/LkBpvl5hdnY', 'https://transportup.com/headlines-breaking-news/carter-copter-acuired-by-jaunt-mobility/', 'http://www.aero-news.net/index.cfm?do=main.textpost&id=ad5fd13d-f3c7-425f-8370-7e38a3545e42', 'https://www.aviationtoday.com/2019/06/11/uber-adds-jaunt-sixth-evtol-manufacturing-partner/', 'https://youtu.be/1JsHzw_UM94']",

Stuttgart Aerospace argues the point that the key to make Urban Air Mobility practical, useful, affordable and made into reality as soon as possible, is that the entire UAM industry needs to focus on using our current infrastructure, from our personal homes (apartments, condos), to all the buildings and structures in our cities, instead of building multiple costly and time consuming vertiports in every city. This way, as soon as eVTOL aircraft are certified airworthy and safe, the general population, businesses and governments, can immediately take advantage of electric UAM in all cities.","['https://www.stuttgartaerospace.com/', 'https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCnqVigdaY93gsMPqfrAReeQ/videos', 'https://www.instagram.com/p/B_U0IGWD-5q/', 'http://www.stuttgart.engineering/']",
